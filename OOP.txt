-we'll see a lot of these two: 
class 
object

-A class can be considered to be a data type 

-inheritence is the way to avoid writing similar code again and again 

-constructors: 
functions who have the same name as the class name 

-private members of a class are those which cant be accessed outside the class 
the point of having private memebers is to not have others change your members

-making memebers private and all is called 'abstraction'

-'encapsulation' is simply bundling classes members and date together 
idea of encapsulation is to get data functions and members together and make a class out of it 


-POLYMORPHISM: 
one name multiple personalities
